KLAMA climbing gym is a group project for the Databases Course at the Wroc≈Çaw University of Science and Technology.

Why KLAMA? 

KLAMA is a climbing institution made-up for the sake of the project. Each of the people working on it has an interest in bouldering therefore it was something familiar for us to have worked on. The word 'klama' itself is a slang used by the climbing community for a big, comfortable and often round climbing hold - also known as a jug.

What can you do at KLAMA?

At KLAMA climbing gym you can buy passes with various durations, to then get inside the gym to climb on many boulder routes, that are routinely changed out to give you the most fun experience. KLAMA is friendly to newcomers! All of the needed equipment, from cheap magnesium to expensive shoes, can be both bought or rented.
